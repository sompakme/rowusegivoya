Abe and Rebecca later shared results of a paternity test. It was then revealed <b>Abe was the little girl's father.</b></span></span><h2>Did Abe and Rebecca have a baby?</h2>Weeks after an old photo of Rebecca and Abe (with a then-unknown baby) sparked a host of theories about the young couple, Rebecca set part of the record straight: She is indeed a mom. "I do have a daughter. She's 19 months old," the 20-year-old revealed during the finale.<h2>How many children does Rebecca from Amish have?</h2>Rebecca tied the knot with her fellow cast member Abe in the season 1 finale and they are still going strong. The couple has two kids together, Kayla and Malika, and the foursome lives in Pennsylvania.<h2>Who is the father of Sabrina's baby on Return to Amish?</h2>Who is Sabrina's baby daddy? Jethro is the father of Sabrina's fourth baby, who is on the way. He is Sabrina's current boyfriend, who she has already shares one son Zekiah with.<h2>Are Rebecca and Abe still together 2021?</h2>Nine years after the first season of the reality show concluded, Abe and Rebecca are still married. Since their time on the hit TLC series, Rebecca and Abe have led relatively quiet lives out of the spotlight.<h2>Who is the father of Rebecca's baby on Breaking Amish?</h2><p></p><h2>What do Abe and Rebecca do for living?</h2>P.S. I got my GED!!" Rebecca wrote in a subsequent post (via Starcasm). Today, Abe works as a truck driver to support his family. Rebecca is a stay-at-home mom who raises their two daughters while her husband is on the road (via Distractify).<h2>What is wrong with Danny's teeth on Return to Amish?</h2>According to Distractify, Daniel accidentally drank Drano, when he was 18 months and hence he has scars on his body. Drano is meant to remove clogs in drains. The doctors had recommended that he should get plastic surgery done to cover the scars up but the Amish community was against the idea.<h2>Does Sabrina Burkholder have her kids?</h2>Burkholder welcomed daughter Kalani Ariyah via cesarean section on Sept. 7, with the newborn weighing 6 lbs., 9 oz., and measuring 19 inches long. Baby Kalani joins older siblings Zekiah, 2, and Skylar, 1. (Burkholder's two older children, ages 7 and 5, reside in the loving care of a family member.)<h2>Does Sabrina from Return to Amish have custody of Oakley?</h2>Sabrina lost custody of Oakley in 2015, reportedly because of her drug issues, and lost custody of her second daughter later on. But we won't be seeing either of those girls on Return to Amish. Sabrina says she gets to see her girls as long as she stays sober, but their adoptive mother doesn't want them on the show.<h2>Is Chapel Schmucker still alive?</h2>No, she's very much alive. There are a few reasons for Chapel's disappearance from the show, but just to set the record straight, the reality TV personality is not dead. She has been under the radar following some dramatic things that have transpired in her life.<h2>Are Rebecca's kids Abes?</h2>Abe and Rebecca later shared results of a paternity test. It was then revealed Abe was the little girl's father. This raised more questions as to whether or not Abe and Rebecca knew he was Kayla's father, seeing they weren't allowed to talk about it.<h2>Did Rebecca sleep with Abe's brother?</h2>A big truth actually came out during the second "Shunning Truth" reunion special for "Breaking Amish: Brave New World." Abe's brother, Andrew, admitted that he and Rebecca had slept together, putting to rest those long-standing rumors. “It was before Abe and them got together," he explained.<h2>Did Matt and Shelly get married?</h2>The season finale of the show ended with Shelly and Matt getting married. Unfortunately, after the show came to an end, there was no update on Matt and Shelly's relationship.<h2>Did Rebecca have a baby?</h2>YouTube star Rebecca Zamolo finally got her rainbow baby. The star of The Game Master network has given birth to her and husband Matt Slays' first child, a daughter named Zadie Hope, following a lengthy infertility battle, during which she suffered two pregnancy losses.<h2>How many miscarriages has Rebecca had?</h2>She became pregnant through IVF months after she suffered a missed miscarriage when she was nine weeks along and documented the devastating moment she found out she had lost her pregnancy on YouTube. It marked her second loss—her first round of IVF ended in a chemical pregnancy, or early miscarriage.<h2>How many children do Mary and Chester Schmucker have?</h2>Andrew, Esther, and Katie Ann are 3 of the 5 children of Mary and Chester Schmucker who have left the Amish.<h2>Why did Sabrina lose Oakley again?</h2>Why did Sabrina lose Oakley? She first lost custody of her daughter in 2015 due to her heroin addiction, and she lost custody of Oakley again last August after a friend allegedly had a heart attack in Sabrina's car and died while Oakley was in the backseat.<h2>Are Jeremiah and Carmela still married?</h2>After several days of fan speculation, Jeremiah took to Instagram on March 25, confirming he and Carmela were “no longer together” and their relationship was “officially done.”<h2>Why did Sabrina lose custody?</h2>The show does not feature the first two daughters of Sabrina because she lost custody due to addiction issues. The mother lost custody of her first daughter, Oakley, due to drug issues in 2015, and later had her second daughter taken away due to her drug issues.<h2>How many children does Sabrina have on Amish?</h2>Who are Sabrina Burkholder's children? Sabrina is a mum-of-four who lives a Mennonite lifestyle. Her children include her two daughters Oakley and Arianna, and son Zekiah, who she had in 2019.<h2>Are Sabrina and Jethro still together?</h2>Sabrina Burkholder and Jethro Nolt are still together.<h2>Did Rebecca from Return to Amish get her GED?</h2>Congratulations are in order for Return to Amish star Rebecca Schmucker! The TLC reality star revealed on social media that she has obtained her GED, making her a high school graduate.<h2>Is Danny and Maureen still together?</h2>We are happy to report that, yes, Maureen and Daniel are engaged to be married. According to Maureen's Facebook, the Return to Amish couple got engaged in July 2020.<h2>Where are Danny and Maureen now?</h2>According to his Facebook page, Daniel is originally from Ohio, but he currently lives in Pennsylvania (which is where Maureen is from). He also has a daughter named Madison Marie with his ex, Rose Spangler.<h2>Is Rosanna and Maureen related?</h2>Its latest season 6 features new members Rosanna miller (Rebecca's cousin) and Maureen (Ada's granddaughter), who, like those who came before them, broke out from their Amish faith and lifestyles and ventured out to experience the urban city life.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmaho2LBqbGMn5itoJWnerCyjKucm52TmK60ecGambJln6N6o77EmqKippdirq610qE%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-the-father-of-rebecca-s-baby-on-breaking-amish.html&text=Who%20is%20the%20father%20of%20Rebecca%27s%20baby%20on%20Breaking%20Amish%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-the-father-of-rebecca-s-baby-on-breaking-amish.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-the-father-of-rebecca-s-baby-on-breaking-amish.html&title=Who%20is%20the%20father%20of%20Rebecca%27s%20baby%20on%20Breaking%20Amish%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-the-father-of-rebecca-s-baby-on-breaking-amish.html&title=Who%20is%20the%20father%20of%20Rebecca%27s%20baby%20on%20Breaking%20Amish%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-the-father-of-rebecca-s-baby-on-breaking-amish.html&title=Who%20is%20the%20father%20of%20Rebecca%27s%20baby%20on%20Breaking%20Amish%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-the-father-of-rebecca-s-baby-on-breaking-amish.html&description=Who%20is%20the%20father%20of%20Rebecca%27s%20baby%20on%20Breaking%20Amish%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-jews-put-stones-on-graves.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Jews Put Stones on Graves">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-kathy-prinze-meet-freddie-prinze-jr-s-mother.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Kathy Prinze?
