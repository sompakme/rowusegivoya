Halyna Hutchins’s husband, Matthew, has come on as an executive producer and stated that the production was moving forward to “honor Halyna’s memory.” Matthew settled with the production of Rust and stated, “I have no interest in engaging in recriminations or attribution of blame (to the producers or Mr. Baldwin)…All of us believe Halyna’s death was a terrible accident.”</p><p>Despite Matthew believing along with the <a href=#>production </a>of Rust that Halyna dying was just a terrible accident, <a href=#>authorities </a>have officially charged Alec Baldwin, the set armorer &nbsp;Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, and assistant director David Halls. Halls took a plea deal and saw his charge lowered to negligent use of a deadly weapon. It is quite interesting that the production is still planning to move forward, even with New Mexico authorities handing down these charges.</p><p>Rust was slated to resume production in January of 2023, though there have been little to no updates, other than the production site being moved. However, Rust Productions LLC’s attorney, Melina Spadone, stated the movie is “on track to be completed with Mr. Alec Baldwin in the lead role and Joel Souza as director.” We would assume the <a href=#>drama </a>behind the movie would have been enough to sink it, but it appears everyone is trying to move forward as best as they can.</p><p>Despite the horrible accident and everything surrounding Rust currently, the movie sounds quite exciting. Rust follows an aging outlaw in 1880s Kansas who comes out of hiding to save his teenage grandson, who is portrayed by Brady Noon. Alec Baldwin plays the role of the aging outlaw, and he is joined by Jensen Ackles, who plays U.S. Marshal Wood Helm, the authority figure who goes after Baldwin’s character. Travis Fimmel is also part of the chase, as he portrays a bounty hunter named Fenton “Preacher” Lang.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/jensen-ackles-alec-baldwin-rust.jpeg><p>It is going to be interesting how Rust is received now that the case has been settled and those responsible have been charged. Alec Baldwin has stated his innocence since the tragic accident took place, and he has been interviewed many times about it. However, he has now been charged with involuntary manslaughter, which could lead to the actor changing his mind about the movie entirely.</p><p>This is just speculation currently, but Rust might still find its way to being canceled, depending on what happens stemming from these new charges. We would imagine that Alec Baldwin is going to fight these charges in court, and we do know that he was not formally charged with also injuring director Joel Souza. Either way, it’s interesting that the movie is still being produced.</p><p>For now, everyone can patiently wait for more updates on Alec Baldwin and Rust. Currently, the production is continuing, which means that we could be seeing this new Western sometime in early 2024. That might also be enough time for everyone to possibly move past the tragic accident that took place, but only time will tell. The movie might draw the ire of too many people to even succeed.</p><p>Alec Baldwin has also been instructed <a href=#>not to speak</a> on the matter any longer, despite the charges brought against him. That is some sound legal advice, as he could find himself in far more trouble if he continues to go against what the authorities have concluded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iqpajBbrnOr6CeZZiWvbGxzaKloGWRobKkecGao52vmaN6pLTAq56eq16dwa64</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frust-movie-still-happening-even-though-alec-baldwin-charged-with-manslaughter.html&text=Rust%20Movie%20Still%20Happening%20Even%20Though%20Alec%20Baldwin%20Charged%20With%20Manslaughter%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frust-movie-still-happening-even-though-alec-baldwin-charged-with-manslaughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frust-movie-still-happening-even-though-alec-baldwin-charged-with-manslaughter.html&title=Rust%20Movie%20Still%20Happening%20Even%20Though%20Alec%20Baldwin%20Charged%20With%20Manslaughter%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frust-movie-still-happening-even-though-alec-baldwin-charged-with-manslaughter.html&title=Rust%20Movie%20Still%20Happening%20Even%20Though%20Alec%20Baldwin%20Charged%20With%20Manslaughter%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frust-movie-still-happening-even-though-alec-baldwin-charged-with-manslaughter.html&title=Rust%20Movie%20Still%20Happening%20Even%20Though%20Alec%20Baldwin%20Charged%20With%20Manslaughter%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frust-movie-still-happening-even-though-alec-baldwin-charged-with-manslaughter.html&description=Rust%20Movie%20Still%20Happening%20Even%20Though%20Alec%20Baldwin%20Charged%20With%20Manslaughter%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-queen-s-cousin-s-manor-house-too-expensive-for-royals-see-incredible-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Queen's cousin's manor house too expensive for royals  see incredible photos">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./og-juan-perez-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Og Juan Perez Net Worth 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
