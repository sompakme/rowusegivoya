I'm sure, in retrospect, J K Rowling would agree that Moody's eye should never have been able to see Harry through the cloak. Yes, possibly sense him in the way Dumbledore can sense the trace that magic leaves.</span></span><h2>How does Moody see through Harrys cloak?</h2>The Invisibility Cloak of the Deathly Hallows is supposed to be unlike other cloaks, which can be detected through alternative means. But, in Goblet of Fire, Barty Crouch - disguised as Mad-Eye Moody - steals Polyjuice ingredients and sees Harry while he's wearing the cloak.<h2>Can Mad Eye Moody see Harry's cloak?</h2>Yes, according to goblet of fire (book), when Harry was underneath the invisibility cloak at three broomsticks, Mad-eye was able to see through it. Yes, this was confirmed in the 4th book. What more, that cloak was one of the Deathly Hallows. If he can see through that one, he can see through any of them.<h2>Can moody see through clothes?</h2>At the Yule ball Mad eye Moody approached Harry and told him he got nice socks he got from Dobby, even though he was wearing a robe over it. That basically means Mad eye Moody can see through clothes.<h2>Where did Mad Eye Moody get his eye?</h2>In the Death Chamber he duelled Antonin Dolohov, but was injured. Harry Potter accidentally stepped on his eye, which was rolling on the floor.<h2>Can Mad-Eye Moody See Boggarts in Their True Form? - Harry Potter Theory</h2><p></p><h2>Who betrayed the 7 Potters?</h2>After Sirius Black's death, Mundungus stole his possessions, including Salazar Slytherin's Locket. He was also somewhat cowardly, as he abandoned Alastor Moody during the Battle of the Seven Potters; Moody was killed by Lord Voldemort.<h2>How did Snape know when Harry was under the Invisibility Cloak?</h2>However it seems that Dumbledore eventually disclosed the cloak to Snape and possibly other teachers, as Snape knew Harry was in possession of the cloak in Prisoner of Azkaban, when Malfoy reported the apparent apparition of Harry's floating head outside the Shrieking Shack, which Snape immediately understood to be ...<h2>Can Dumbledore see through invisibility cloaks?</h2>Originally Answered: Can Albus dumbledore look through the invisibility cloak? No, he cannot because it is a Hallow and no spell can enable someone to see through it, not even Death can see what the cloak conceals.<h2>Can Mad Eye see through walls?</h2>He swiveled his magical eye around and confirmed that there was indeed a boggart. The first time I read this part it seemed pretty "normal"; he can see through walls or whatever.<h2>How did Moody have an Invisibility Cloak?</h2>He mentioned that Podmore had not had the manners to return it in a timely fashion and forced Moody to use his second best cloak. This was because Podmore had been placed under the Imperius Curse by Death Eaters.<h2>How did Dumbledore know that Harry and Ron were under the Invisibility Cloak?</h2>In Chamber of Secrets, Dumbledore uses Homenum Revelio to see Harry and Ron under the Invisibility Cloak in Hagrid's hut: 'However,' said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly, so that none of them could miss a word, 'you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me.<h2>How did Alastor Moody lose his leg?</h2>It is believed that it was his activities during the First Wizarding War and his time as an Auror that led to Moody losing a leg (replaced by a wooden prosthesis).<h2>Is there only 1 invisibility cloak?</h2>Only one Invisibility Cloak, the third of the three Hallows, and supposedly the Cloak of Death himself, does not suffer the ravages of time, and cannot be damaged by magic.<h2>Was Harry's cloak a deathly hallow?</h2>The Cloak of Invisibility was a magical artefact used to render the wearer invisible, and one of the fabled Deathly Hallows. In The Tale of the Three Brothers, it was the third and final Hallow created, supposedly by Death himself (whom had the cloak in his possession at that time).<h2>Why did Barty Crouch Jr help Harry?</h2>Barty Crouch Jr. wanted to make sure his students could fight off the Imperius Curse. He seemed more passionate about that curse than any of the other Unforgivable Curses.<h2>Can Dumbledore block Avada Kedavra?</h2>At the end of Fantastic Beasts 3 though, Grindelwald attempts to use Avada Kedavra on Credence, but Albus and Aberforth Dumbledore successfully block it using golden magic.<h2>Did Dumbledore know the cloak was a hallow?</h2>When he got the ring, he didn't have the cloak anymore. He was aware he had all of the hallows at some point, though. Absolutely, although he never had all three at the same time (neither did Harry, btw).<h2>Can Dumbledore understand parseltongue?</h2>Professor Dumbledore could understand it<p>As J.K Rowling revealed, Albus Dumbledore had mastered Parseltongue too â€“ although he could not speak it aloud. We're not sure why Albus learnt the language, but perhaps the Hogwarts headmaster wanted a better understanding of Voldemort.</p><h2>How did James have the invisibility cloak?</h2>how did james get the invisibility cloak | Fandom. His dad gave it to him. To elaborate on Icecreamdif's answer, he inherited it as a family heirloom dating back to Hardwin Potter, who married Iolanthe Peverell, granddaughter of the Cloak's original owner Ignotus.<h2>Why did James Potter bully Snape?</h2>James and Snape had a strong rivalry throughout their time at Hogwarts. To Remus and Sirius, the reason this rivalry began was due to Snape's jealousy over James' talent at Quidditch and his popularity, as well as Snape's interest in the Dark Arts, which James despised.<h2>Did Voldemort know Snape was a spy?</h2>Voldemort in turn knew the first half of the prophecy from Snape. He knew from his own knowledge of the wizarding world and his spies (presumably) that the prophecy could refer to either the Potters or the Longbottoms, and he knew from Snape that Dumbledore knew this too (if not more).<h2>Why did Snape curse George's ear?</h2>The injury was caused by Snape's Sectumsempra spell in order to stop the Death Eaters from hurting George (who he thought was Harry) and Lupin, but missed and hit George.<h2>Who killed Hedwig?</h2>With the issue of Harry's iconic owl at the forefront, Jo Marie Walker continues to explain that the Death Eater that kills Hedwig is none other than Snape.<h2>Was Stan shunpike a Death Eater?</h2>Stanley "Stan" Shunpike (born c. 1975) was a wizard and was the conductor and helper of the Knight Bus. In 1996, he was arrested and sent to Azkaban for being a Death Eater when he was overheard claiming to have inside information about the organisation, although in all likelihood, he was only fooling around.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahsGabkaN6rrvOnbBmq5Waeqmt0auwrGWTobyitw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-can-moody-see-harry-s-cloak.html&text=Why%20can%20moody%20see%20Harry%27s%20cloak%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-can-moody-see-harry-s-cloak.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-can-moody-see-harry-s-cloak.html&title=Why%20can%20moody%20see%20Harry%27s%20cloak%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-can-moody-see-harry-s-cloak.html&title=Why%20can%20moody%20see%20Harry%27s%20cloak%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-can-moody-see-harry-s-cloak.html&title=Why%20can%20moody%20see%20Harry%27s%20cloak%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-can-moody-see-harry-s-cloak.html&description=Why%20can%20moody%20see%20Harry%27s%20cloak%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./zac-efron-says-brother-dylan-efron-will-win-the-traitors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zac Efron Says Brother Dylan Efron Will Win 'The Traitors'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./towtruck-jess-arrest-age-gofundme-main-updates-real-name.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TowTruck Jess: arrest, age, GoFundMe, main updates, real name">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
