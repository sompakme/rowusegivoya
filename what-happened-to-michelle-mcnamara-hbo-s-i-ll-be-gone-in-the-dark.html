But the series, which premieres&nbsp;<strong>June 28</strong>, is just as much about McNamara as it is the predator who's responsible for 12 murders, 48 rapes, and more than 100 burglaries in the '70s and '80s.&nbsp;McNamara, the hero of the well-reviewed series, was happily married to standup comedian and actor Patton Oswalt and mom to their daughter Alice; she obsessively conducted research and interviews for her popular blog, True Crime Diary, in her spare time. Before McNamara tragically passed away in 2016 at the age of 46, she was bringing together disparate pieces of information from different police files to form one, cohesive look at&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.latimes.com/projects/man-in-the-window-joe-DeAngelo-golden-state-killer-serial/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>one of the most prolific killers</a>&nbsp;in United States history.</p><p>In one of the interviews with McNamara that made it into the series, she explains, "The great tragedy of this case, to me, is that it's not better known." Arguably, the work she did to highlight, bring together, and uncover new information changed that. McNamara gave the Golden State Killer his nickname—he'd been given several in different areas, including the East Area Rapist, the Original Night Stalker, and the Visalia Ransacker, but it wasn't clear that they were the same person—and the spotlight her bestselling book placed on his crimes reestablished a popular awareness about what he'd done.</p><p>If you know anything about Oswalt, you'll have some context on McNamara, because the comedian spoke glowingly about his wife both on- and off-stage. There were funny stories about&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://youtu.be/SvbiGp_Evgo referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>rats and house-hunting gone horribly wrong</a>, but as silly and as hilarious as the stories were, he always made very clear that his wife was the fixed center and the inspiration of his life. He shared McNamara's horribly prescient mantra about the world—"It's chaos. Be kind."—in a comedy special after her death.</p><p>McNamara was obsessed with cold cases, and devoted the last few years of her life to cracking the case of the Golden State Killer. Working with detectives, she spent many, many hours on Internet research, interviews, visiting crime scenes, and following leads.
