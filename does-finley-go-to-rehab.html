And Dani gets arrested for criminal contempt of court.</span></span><h2>Does Finley have a drinking problem?</h2>Most of Finley's friends seem to associate her drinking with being a “party girl,” so she's only beginning to realize that her drinking is a problem. But the consequences of her drinking have been building throughout the season, bringing her closer to having to face her alcoholism.<h2>Is Finley in season 2 of The L Word?</h2>The L Word: Generation Q season 2 has kept viewers on their toes with Finley (played by Jacqueline Toboni) and Sophie's will they/won't they relationship.<h2>What happened to Finley L Word?</h2>Sadly, as she danced the night away, Marcus died, leaving Bette and Tina heartbroken for their daughter. Meanwhile, a disappeared Finley finally turned up drunk out of her mind at Dani's apartment in a true rock bottom moment. With more drama in store, let's dive into the finale.<h2>Does Sophie end up with Finley?</h2>The two were set to marry in the season 2 premiere, but the ceremony was interrupted by Finley, who admitted to having feelings for Sophie. Soon after Dani called off their relationship, Sophie and Finley wound up getting together.<h2>UnityPoint Health - Finley Hospital Day in the Life of an Acute Rehab Nurse</h2><p></p><h2>Does Sophie choose Daniel or Finley?</h2>Viewers quickly learned that Sophie Suarez (Rosanny Zayas) chose Dani Núñez (Arienne Mandi) over Finley (Jacqueline Toboni), resolving the cliffhanger from the season 1 finale.<h2>Does Sophie cheat on Dani?</h2>Sophie IS likely to leave Dani when times get hard.

That story came out of our writers room. A lot of us had similar experiences of being epically deceived by somebody that we were dating. Bette lost the mayoral race and found out the opioid crisis position she was offered is a trap.<h2>What language does Gigi speak on The L Word?</h2>Gigi is fluent in Farsi and often converses with her children in the language.<h2>Will there be Gen Q season 3 L Word?</h2>So far, the exact release date for The L Word: Generation Q Season 3 has not been shared. However, Showtime has said the series will be back in 2022. Considering the time it typically takes for a show to go through the stages of production, a late 2022 release date seems likely.<h2>Does Dani like Bette?</h2>Dani quickly developed an admiration towards Bette and came to her one day, offering her help to handle PR for her campaign.<h2>Is Carmen coming back to L Word?</h2>Unfortunately, showrunner and director Marja-Lewis Ryan has shut down the possibility of Carmen's return. With the series aiming to have greater representation and diversity, they don't want to have an Iranian-American actor continue playing a Latina. Ryan told The Hollywood Reporter, “I love Sarah Shahi.<h2>How old is Finley from L word?</h2>Jacqueline Toboni, currently known for starring as the lovable disaster lesbian Finley on Showtime's The L Word: Generation Q, is engaged! The 29-year-old actress popped the question to her beautiful longtime girlfriend, Australian actress Kassandra Clementi, in front of the ocean — and Clementi said yes!<h2>Who is Claudia on The L Word?</h2>Isis King: Claudia Hanson.<h2>Does Bette get elected?</h2>But then, Bette loses the election. It's a blow to Bette, particularly because of her reasons for running and because it all seemed so hopeful at the beginning.<h2>Does Bette adopt Angelica?</h2>It is revealed that during the last ten years, Bette and Tina did get married, but also got divorced after Tina left Bette for another woman, Carrie, with Bette getting at least partial custody of Angelica, who now lives with her.<h2>Does Tina stay with Bette?</h2>Bette and Tina's often turbulent relationship ended with the couple in a good place as they were last seen raising their daughter, Angie, together, and heading for New York to legally tie the knot. However, Generation Q revealed that Bette and Tina had recently divorced and were co-parenting Angie.<h2>How did original L Word end?</h2>The original series ended on a major cliffhanger with police calling in Jenny Schecter's friends for questioning over her death. The mystery of who killed Jenny Schecter was finally solved in the reboot, The L Word: Generation Q.<h2>What happened to Tina in The L Word: Generation Q?</h2>She is the mother of Angelica Porter-Kennard and initially the life partner of Bette Porter, though the two become on-again-off-again lovers in later seasons, and eventually marry and divorce between the events of The L Word and Generation Q.<h2>Who is Tess in L Word?</h2>Tess Van De Berg is a recurring character in seasons one and two of The L Word: Generation Q. She is portrayed by Jamie Clayton and debuts in "Less Is More".<h2>Does Sophie tell Dani about Finley?</h2>As much as Sophie wanted to tell Dani the truth about her and Finley, she couldn't bring herself to do it. She ultimately took Alice up on her word not to tell Dani, but it wound up coming out — on their wedding day.<h2>What did Dani's dad do L Word?</h2>After last week's episode, I thought that Dani's dad had died. But nope! Instead, he is arrested for criminal conspiracy and fraud, and Dani escapes to Ojai, California to avoid being deposed by lawyers. Meanwhile, Finley gets hired to be a referee for children's soccer, and I could not love that more for her.<h2>Is The L Word: Generation Q season over?</h2>Showtime's "The L Word: Generation Q" has been renewed for a third season, four months after its sophomore finale aired in October 2021.<h2>Why did Shane and Quiara break up?</h2>Even though she signed the divorce papers, she had a fling with Quiara, who was pregnant but ended up losing her baby. As Shane never wanted kids, this put another strain in their relationship because Quiara thought she was relieved there wouldn't be a baby.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OonKxllp67rbHYZp6oZaSkerOxx5qZ</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdoes-finley-go-to-rehab.html&text=Does%20Finley%20go%20to%20rehab%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-finley-go-to-rehab.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-finley-go-to-rehab.html&title=Does%20Finley%20go%20to%20rehab%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdoes-finley-go-to-rehab.html&title=Does%20Finley%20go%20to%20rehab%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-finley-go-to-rehab.html&title=Does%20Finley%20go%20to%20rehab%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-finley-go-to-rehab.html&description=Does%20Finley%20go%20to%20rehab%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./genevieve-o-reilly-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Genevieve OReilly Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bobby-unser-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bobby Unser Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
