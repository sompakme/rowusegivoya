Yes, they were promoting the second installation of Magic Mike <span data-scayt_word=XXL data-scaytid=4>XXL</span>, but it wasn’t the Warner Bros. marketing team or even publicly out <span data-scayt_word=Bomer data-scaytid=5>Bomer</span> who made that call: It was straight, married Tatum who rang <span data-scayt_word=Bomer data-scaytid=6>Bomer</span> last minute and suggested the idea.</p><p>On the day before in Pittsburgh, <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_nick-jonas data-tag=nick-jonas>Nick Jonas</a></strong>, a man of many girlfriends of the model-actress-Miss Universe variety, performed at the city’s <span data-scayt_word=LGBT data-scaytid=11>LGBT</span> Pride festival. It seems these days that straight male stars aren’t stressed out at being perceived as gay or extremely gay-friendly. Far from feeling stigmatized, they welcome the gay gaze, staring invitingly and modeling shirtless on the covers of such gay magazines as Out and The Advocate, or both. With the current crop of “straight homos” — call them “<span data-scayt_word=stromos data-scaytid=12>stromos</span>” — some very blurred lines have emerged.</p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Stromo_1_embed.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Nick Jonas</p><p>These are not your mother’s <span data-scayt_word=metrosexuals data-scaytid=14>metrosexuals</span>, a term coined in 1994 by British social critic <strong>Mark Simpson</strong>, who called out straight men for indulging in feminine-seeming pedicures and hair products. Today’s <span data-scayt_word=stromos data-scaytid=15>stromos</span> are the flip side of gay actors who want to read straight for their careers: They are straight actors striving to read <span data-scayt_word=gayish data-scaytid=17>gayish</span> to optimize their appeal — and maximize the number of butts, gym-molded or otherwise, in movie theater seats.</p><p>The number of straight actors who have appeared on Out covers — <strong>Chris <span data-scayt_word=Hemsworth data-scaytid=19>Hemsworth</span></strong>, <strong>Chris Pine</strong>,<strong> Kit <span data-scayt_word=Harington data-scaytid=20>Harington</span></strong> and <strong>Josh <span data-scayt_word=Hutcherson data-scaytid=21>Hutcherson</span></strong>, among others — has jumped in recent years. In 2011, there were two out of 12 covers; in 2012, three. By 2013, there were five, nearly half of the year’s available covers. “When Channing Tatum did the cover for Magic Mike for the June 2012 issue, it opened the door for other guys,” notes Out editor-in-chief <strong>Aaron&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Hicklin data-scaytid=22>Hicklin</span></strong>. “We’ve had straight men who are comfortable with their sexuality on the cover before. <strong><span data-scayt_word=Keanu data-scaytid=23>Keanu</span> Reeves</strong> was on the cover of our <span data-scayt_word=20th data-scaytid=24>20th</span> anniversary issue in 1995. Now a lot more straight guys are playing gay roles than ever before — and are happy to be on our covers. They request our covers, gay role or not.”</p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Stromo_2_embed.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This might have a little to do with the first Magic Mike bringing in more than $167 million worldwide. “Studios are realizing that gay people don’t just go to gay movies. We go to every movie,” says <strong>Craig <span data-scayt_word=Karpel data-scaytid=28>Karpel</span></strong>, owner of the <span data-scayt_word=Karpel data-scaytid=29>Karpel</span> Group, which conducts promotional campaigns to connect movies to the <span data-scayt_word=LGBT data-scaytid=25>LGBT</span> market. “For basically straight films, we’re hired to do gift bags at nightlife events, festivals, parades, gay bars and clubs. The competition for clients to market in gay clubs is fierce — it’s a captive audience.”</p><p>Slate PR founder and co-owner <strong>Simon Halls</strong> (clients include <strong>Tom Ford</strong>, <strong>Ryan Murphy </strong>and <strong>Ridley Scott</strong>), who is married to and raising three sons with <span data-scayt_word=Bomer data-scaytid=27>Bomer</span>, ponders what has changed since <strong>Woody <span data-scayt_word=Harrelson data-scaytid=32>Harrelson</span></strong> posed in 1997 for an Out cover promoting The People vs. Larry <span data-scayt_word=Flynt data-scaytid=36>Flynt</span>. “This isn’t just a sexuality comfort issue,” says Halls. “It’s also a demographic shift. If you look at polls, many people over 60 have all kinds of prejudices; under 40, everyone supports gay rights and most people don’t care about labels anymore. Not only that, magazines that cater to the gay community guarantee beautiful shots. Publicists love beautiful covers as much as stars do.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Gaydar increasingly is feeling broken in Hollywood and New York and is a dead issue in Europe. “It’s a common question at parties: ‘Is he gay — or European?’ ” laughs Details editor-in-chief <strong>Dan Peres</strong>, describing both civilian and celebrity stromos. “His suit is more tapered, he owns a yoga mat. <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_adam-levine data-tag=adam-levine>Adam Levine</a> </strong>has made it safe for straight guys to wear deep V-necks. Now gay and straight men shop at the same stores, go to the same hairdressers and tailors. Straight men want the same things as gay men — except the gender of their sexual partners.”</p><p>Cornell University psychology professor <strong>Ritch Savin-Williams</strong> begs to differ even on that point and has said partner-gender preference isn’t as clear as it used to be for “mostly straight” young men who consider LGBT equality the movement of their generation. On the Kinsey heterosexual-homosexual sliding scale, established by sex researcher <strong>Alfred C. Kinsey</strong>, Savin-Williams calls men who fall within heterosexuality but toward the gay side of the scale “Kinsey 1’s,” explaining: “Their primary object of desire is women. They’re not giving that up — they’re adding to it.” Just ask ultimate stromo <strong>James Franco</strong>, who recently announced, “I’m gay in my life up to the point of intercourse.” Other presumable Hollywood Kinsey 1’s: <strong>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</strong>, who never refutes gay innuendos (“That would be really tacky,” is his sentiment); and <strong>Tom Hardy</strong>. Now married to Peaky Blinders actress <strong>Charlotte Riley</strong>, the Mad Max star has shared that he experimented with men when he was younger.</p><p>Stromos don’t necessarily have to walk the walk but can talk a good game about their man-crushes: <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong> admits that if he were gay, it would be with <strong>Robert Pattinson</strong>. <strong>Daniel Radcliffe</strong> says he would fancy <strong>Ryan Gosling</strong> (who wouldn’t?). In times past, when Marlboro men and tough-guy icons like <strong>Jack Nicholson</strong>, <strong>Gene Hackman</strong>, <strong>Al Pacino </strong>and <strong>Robert De Niro</strong> reigned, bromance subjects Pattinson and Gosling might have sued or worse at any implication of gayness. That’s not the case today.</p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Stromo_3_embed.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“The current straight actors are more than comfortable with gay men desiring them,” explains Out‘s Hicklin. “My straight friends love it when gay men flirt. What else is acting but a bid for attention?” Social critic Simpson agrees: “The male desire to be desired is more rampant than ever. Today’s men are shameless hussies. That’s a problem for actors: Young straight male moviegoers are so image-conscious and keen to attract the eye, the man onscreen has to go the extra mile with harder workouts. As their audience becomes ‘gayer,’ they have to become gayer or end up looking dad-ish.” (Note the viral term ‘dad bod’ for anyone without a six pack.)</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Ergo, appearance still makes the stromo. Primo stromo <strong>David Beckham</strong> may be among the first U.K. footballer to give interviews to gay magazines and may have expressed pride in his gay-icon status, but he’s equally if not more famous for braiding his hair, painting his nails and posing in Emporio Armani underwear in a 2009-2010 campaign for a reported 20 million pounds. Slender and big-lipped former model <strong>Eddie Redmayne</strong>, who plays a transgender woman in The Danish Girl, out this fall, also is an exemplary stromo. Confesses male-celebrity hairdresser<strong> Sean James</strong>: “I’m not sure when gay and straight looks swapped, but men in general are marketing themselves much more these days so they can have the perfect dating profile picture for Tinder to meet girls or guys.”</p><p>Services have followed accordingly. Today in Los Angeles, there are nail salons just for men (Hammer & Nails on Melrose), straight guys going for eyebrow shaping (brow queen <strong>Anastasia Soare</strong> says, “Male stars come in the salon all the time and are fine if someone takes their picture”) and the pursuit of the gay male-body ideal. “Shredded trumps pumped,” says celebrity trainer <strong>Jason Wimberly</strong>. “Young Hollywood is packing yoga classes and spin studios to create a longer leaner physique than body proportions of yore.” Adds <strong>Jodi Shays</strong>, owner of the Queen Bee waxing chain, who has seen her male clientele increase 35 percent this year: “We are seeing more men do fingers and toes, bum cheeks, male bikini lines and the full bro-zilian. Our straight guys versus gay guys is an even split.”</p><p>Simpson sums up the reason for the rise of <span data-scayt_word=stromos data-scaytid=9>stromos</span>: “Men increasingly want to present themselves as available for fantasy to both sexes — especially if they’re heterosexual.” Echoing a June 18 comment by actor-of-the-moment <strong>Chris Pratt </strong>(who wants to “not objectify women less but objectify men just as often”), Simpson adds: “Women no longer own that province of objectification. Straight men now want to be sex objects — and what better way to get objectified than by other <span data-scayt_word=penised data-scaytid=10>penised</span> human beings?”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGeZo8Gzu8OumqKml2LAtb7OpqZmr5iuerTA0ZqgoKCkYrqiuMRmb2lsYm5%2BcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fintroducing-the-stromo-why-straight-male-stars-are-going-gay-ish.html&text=Introducing%20the%20Stromo%21%20Why%20Straight%20Male%20Stars%20are%20Going%20Gay%28ish%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fintroducing-the-stromo-why-straight-male-stars-are-going-gay-ish.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fintroducing-the-stromo-why-straight-male-stars-are-going-gay-ish.html&title=Introducing%20the%20Stromo%21%20Why%20Straight%20Male%20Stars%20are%20Going%20Gay%28ish%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fintroducing-the-stromo-why-straight-male-stars-are-going-gay-ish.html&title=Introducing%20the%20Stromo%21%20Why%20Straight%20Male%20Stars%20are%20Going%20Gay%28ish%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fintroducing-the-stromo-why-straight-male-stars-are-going-gay-ish.html&title=Introducing%20the%20Stromo%21%20Why%20Straight%20Male%20Stars%20are%20Going%20Gay%28ish%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fintroducing-the-stromo-why-straight-male-stars-are-going-gay-ish.html&description=Introducing%20the%20Stromo%21%20Why%20Straight%20Male%20Stars%20are%20Going%20Gay%28ish%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kimberley-walsh-posts-heartfelt-tribute-to-husband-justin-on-wedding-anniversary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kimberley Walsh posts heartfelt tribute to husband Justin on wedding anniversary">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-much-money-does-zola-taylor-make-latest-zola-taylor-net-worth-income-salary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Zola Taylor Make?
