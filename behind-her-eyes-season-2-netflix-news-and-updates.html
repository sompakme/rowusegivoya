With just six episodes in the first season, fans are itching to know if the series will return for an equally unexpected and absurd second season. Here's everything we know about&nbsp;Behind Her Eyes&nbsp;season 2.</p><h2 id=how-does-season-1-end-3>How does season 1 end?</h2><p>It's a convoluted journey, to say the least. (See the detailed&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a35537409/behind-her-eyes-ending-explained/>breakdown of the ending here</a>.) But, long story short: Louise (Simona Brown), whose body has been hijacked by Rob's soul, marries David (Tom Bateman), who thinks his previous wife Adele has died of an overdose. (She did not. Rob also killed her.) The two are planning their honeymoon, but Louise's young son, Adam (Tyler Howitt), suspects something is up with his mom.</p><h2 id=what-could-season-2-of-xa0-behind-her-eyes-xa0-be-about-3>What could season 2 of&nbsp;Behind Her Eyes&nbsp;be about?</h2><p>Based on the sinister glare "Louise" (a.k.a. Rob) gives Adam in the final shot of season 1, season 2&nbsp;could&nbsp;be&nbsp;about the lengths Rob-Louise goes through to cover up her evil secrets—including getting rid of her son. Considering Adam and Louise's relationship was the main emotional anchor of the first season, it would be an absolutely heart-wrenching route and undeniably dark path to explore.</p><p>There were also breadcrumbs laid in the first season about Louise's relationship with her ex-husband—perhaps the second season could see her ex catching onto Rob-Louise and fighting to protect his son and avenge his ex-wife?</p><p>Behind Her Eyes&nbsp;could also take a page out of the book of another Netflix hit,&nbsp;You.&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a30224608/you-season-3-cast-netflix/>In&nbsp;You</a>, serial killer Joe goes from city to city meeting, and eventually hurting, different women while also torturing the people in their lives. That same anthology format could lend itself easily to&nbsp;Behind Her Eyes&nbsp;if it has a second iteration—after all, David and Adele came to town for a fresh start, so it's not so farfetched to assume David and Louise would do the same.</p><p>Season 2 would also hopefully flesh out David's character more, exploring his backstory and motivations as well as show Rob facing repercussions for his heinous soul-swapping acts. Ideally, if the show were renewed, production wouldn't make the mistake of exactly copying the first season; it would fall flat since audiences are already aware of Rob's shocking secret.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jm27xgEjPS8Ls2Byc8ir4Q-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=there-apos-s-no-more-book-material-3>There's no more book material.</h2><p>Season 1 of&nbsp;Behind Her Eyes&nbsp;closely followed the plot laid out in Sarah Pinborough's book of the same name, which means there's no pre-existing material left for Netflix to adapt into another season. (Though it has been done before with book-to-show series like&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/big-little-lies/>Big Little Lies</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Handmaid's Tale.) But Pinborough's book did delve into Rob-Louise plotting to harm Adam, so if Netflix does move forward they could pull on that (ill-advised) thread.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><p>Pinborough also wasn't involved with the first season, so it's unlikely she'd come on board to pen any more storylines for a new season. The author also told&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.express.co.uk/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Express.co.uk</a>&nbsp;that she has no knowledge currently about a second season. "I would be interested to see where they would take it as it's a pretty closed ending. But if it does well, you never know," she said.</p><h2 id=could-the-cast-return-for-season-2-3>Could the cast return for season 2?</h2><p>While&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g35539524/behind-her-eyes-cast-netflix/>the cast</a>&nbsp;hasn't confirmed or denied any future involvement in the Netflix series, it's safe to assume that Eve Hewson, at least, wouldn't be in the show based on the events of season 1. But never say never with this show; Hewson's Adele could always return as a ghost, haunting Rob-Louise's dreams. Or perhaps she'll appear in flashbacks that reveal more about her history with David and Rob. Or TBH, she might just be back because astral projection is bonkers.</p><p>Whatever the case, Hewson would probably be on board for any reincarnation of the character, no matter how outlandish: She recently told&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://collider.com/behind-her-eyes-eve-hewson-interview-twist-netflix/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Collider</a>&nbsp;that playing Adele has been a major thrill of her career. "I genuinely loved this character so much, mainly because of the twist. I’ve never had more fun playing a character in my life. If I could play Adele until the day that I'm dead, I wouldn't care," she said. "There were so many possibilities, because of the twist, for how I could interpret Adele, and that just gave it more life. It's so not 'what you see is what you get.' Also, the idea of tricking the characters and tricking the audience, and all of those layers, was glorious. I really enjoyed it."</p><p>For now, consider getting your fix of the cast in their buzzy upcoming projects. Hewson is playing Anna Wetherell in Starz's&nbsp;The Luminaries, an adaptation of the celebrated novel. And Batemen is set to appear in the star-studded film&nbsp;Death on the Nile, alongside Rose Leslie, Gal Gadot, Letitia Wright, and Kenneth Branagh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomGxtZWl9eX%2BUaJmeoJmjsW60xKtknrGVqHq0scCspqdlYmQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbehind-her-eyes-season-2-netflix-news-and-updates.html&text=%27Behind%20Her%20Eyes%27%20Season%202%20%7c%20Netflix%20News%20and%20Updates&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbehind-her-eyes-season-2-netflix-news-and-updates.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbehind-her-eyes-season-2-netflix-news-and-updates.html&title=%27Behind%20Her%20Eyes%27%20Season%202%20%7c%20Netflix%20News%20and%20Updates" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbehind-her-eyes-season-2-netflix-news-and-updates.html&title=%27Behind%20Her%20Eyes%27%20Season%202%20%7c%20Netflix%20News%20and%20Updates" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbehind-her-eyes-season-2-netflix-news-and-updates.html&title=%27Behind%20Her%20Eyes%27%20Season%202%20%7c%20Netflix%20News%20and%20Updates" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbehind-her-eyes-season-2-netflix-news-and-updates.html&description=%27Behind%20Her%20Eyes%27%20Season%202%20%7c%20Netflix%20News%20and%20Updates" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./a-mother-s-crusade-for-a-missing-daughter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Mother's Crusade for a Missing Daughter">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-hisoka-s-boyfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Hisoka's boyfriend?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
