Sinestro is a former Green Lantern Corps member who was dishonorably discharged for abusing his power.</span></span><h2>Are there evil Green Lanterns?</h2>The villainous version of Green Lantern is known as Power Ring. Just as Green Lantern rings are used as tools for galactic peace, the power ring is used on Earth-3 (or in the Anti-Matter universe) as a weapon of villainy.<h2>Is the Green Lantern good or evil?</h2>Green Lantern is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. They fight evil with the aid of rings that grant them a variety of extraordinary powers, all of which come from imagination, fearlessness and/or emotional willpower.<h2>What is Green Lanterns greatest enemy?</h2>Sinestro is, without question, Hal Jordan's archenemy, not just because of the threat he poses, but because of how close he once was to our hero. Sinestro was himself one of the greatest Green Lanterns, and even took it upon himself to train a rookie Hal Jordan.<h2>Who is the most evil Lantern Corps?</h2>6 SINESTRO<p>Thaal Sinestro could be considered as the Green Lantern Corps' greatest enemy. Considering that he started out as a Green Lantern himself and dropped his green ring of will for the yellow ring of fear, he has been a thorn in Hal Jordan's side for a very long time.</p><h2>DC Metal "Dawnbreaker, Batman as Evil Green Lantern" - Rebirth Complete Story | Comicstorian</h2><p></p><h2>Who is Wonder Woman's arch enemy?</h2>The current Cheetah, Barbara Ann Minerva, is a former archeologist and treasure-hunter who sold her soul to the plant-god Urtzkartaga for power and immortality, not realizing she would be bound in eternal servitude to him. She, aside from Circe and Ares, is arguably Wonder Woman's deadliest archenemy.<h2>Are red lanterns evil?</h2>The Red Lantern Corps are a major villainous organization, functioning as anti-heroes throughout much of the DC universe and they were enemies of the Green Lantern Corps. Their power is derived from the emotional spectrum, particularly the Red Light of Rage.<h2>Are yellow lanterns evil?</h2>The Sinestro Corps, also known as Yellow Lantern Corps, is a supervillainous analog to the Green Lantern Corps in the DC Universe. Their power is derived from the emotional electromagnetic spectrum of fear; the corps is led by the supervillain Sinestro.<h2>Why does Sinestro hate Hal Jordan?</h2>And it was capable of breaking through any form generated by a Green Lantern ring. It is more than a desire for revenge against the Green Lantern Corps that has caused Sinestro to especially hate and strike at Hal Jordan.<h2>Are the Indigo Lanterns evil?</h2>They're actually a group created by Abin Sur to help him defeat the Guardians of the Universe in the event that they turn evil.<h2>Is the Orange Lantern evil?</h2>With the added benefit of having an entire army of what are essentially avarice ghosts at your beck and call, the Orange Lanterns are an overwhelming force of evil that is twisted further by the power of a ring that always wants more.<h2>Is the color yellow Green Lantern's weakness?</h2>The impurity rendered the rings powerless over yellow -- and when the Central Battery was destroyed in Green Lantern #50 (1993), the weakness was removed for the next generation. In the years since the "Emerald Twilight" story removed the weakness to yellow, it has been redefined.<h2>Is there a GREY Lantern Corps?</h2>The Grey Lantern Corps is one of the Lantern Corps. The Grey Lanterns draw their power from their members' absolute apathy. As such, only members of Hattar's species can qualify for being Grey Lanterns.<h2>Are black lanterns evil?</h2>Instead, they are malevolent beings who seek to murder even those they considered friends. As demonstrated by Batman, a Black Lantern ring is also capable of resurrecting people other than the wielder.<h2>What is the most powerful Lantern color?</h2>Blue Lantern Corps<p>It is the most powerful color but also the most difficult to master and needs Green nearby to reach its full potential. Blue can, however, drain Yellow rings of their power and suppress Red and Orange.</p><h2>What is the Purple Lantern Corps?</h2>Violet (Star Sapphire) Lantern Corps<p>The Violet Power Ring is worn by those who fully know the true value love — be it through loss or gain. If you are a lover who knows full well what love is, the Star Sapphires would make a good choice.</p><h2>What can Blue Lanterns do?</h2>Blue Lanterns can heal wounds and regenerate lost body parts. The ring's power can be supplemented with the hope of other living beings; for instance, Saint Walker and Warth were able to reduce a dying sun's age by 8.6 billion years because of the hope emanating from the inhabitants of a nearby planet.<h2>Who is Batman's greatest enemy?</h2>The ultimate Batman villain is a deranged psychopath who acts as more of an agent of chaos than an organised criminal. Also known as the Clown Prince of Crime, the Joker is the arch-enemy of the Dark Knight — one capable of such unthinkable evil that can make even Batman shudder.<h2>Why does the Cheetah hate Wonder Woman?</h2>End of dialog window. The original Cheetah appeared in Wonder Woman #6 in 1943, making her one of Diana's earliest foes. Vain and spoiled debutante Priscilla Rich had no super powers to speak of, and was intensely jealousy of Wonder Woman.<h2>Why did Cheetah become a villain?</h2>In the possession of a dagger once belonging to a lost tribe of Amazons, she accidentally cut herself on it. This caused her to become possessed by the "Goddess of the Hunt", transforming her into a human-cheetah hybrid.<h2>What does Black Lantern stand for?</h2>Black Lantern Corps Oath<p>The Black Lantern Corps are the slain and deceased beings from throughout the universe who fell into the domain of the dead. They are the army of Nekron, the Lord of the Unliving, and their purpose is to eliminate all life. The Black Lantern Rings are wielded by the deceased.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8CrnGasmJq%2FpnnAp7BmnaaeuW6z0Z6cp2Wclru1sdGnqg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fare-there-any-evil-green-lanterns.html&text=Are%20there%20any%20evil%20Green%20Lanterns%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-there-any-evil-green-lanterns.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-there-any-evil-green-lanterns.html&title=Are%20there%20any%20evil%20Green%20Lanterns%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fare-there-any-evil-green-lanterns.html&title=Are%20there%20any%20evil%20Green%20Lanterns%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fare-there-any-evil-green-lanterns.html&title=Are%20there%20any%20evil%20Green%20Lanterns%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-there-any-evil-green-lanterns.html&description=Are%20there%20any%20evil%20Green%20Lanterns%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./can-thyroid-cause-anger-issues.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Can thyroid cause anger issues?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-dhs-in-philadelphia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Dhs In Philadelphia">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
