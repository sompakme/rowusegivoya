It was my dad who broke the news to my grandma.</i></p><p><strong>How did you react to the sad news?</strong></p><p><i>The normal reaction when you lose someone you love, but because I was young, you won’t compare the kind of feeling I had then with what I would have had now. If my mum had just died, the way I would have felt now is definitely not the way I had felt then. Then, I was just like, “Oh, my mother died” and I cried</i></p><p><strong>Looking back, what do you think you would have benefited if she were to be around now?</strong></p><p><i>I cannot begin to count the benefits. There would have been a lot, especially when I was in the University. I really felt the vacuum. A lot of mothers were always coming around, bringing palm oil and other stuff for their daughter that was when it actually dawned on me that I didn’t have a mum. My daddy cannot bring palm oil though he would always come to see me, but that is not comparable to the impact of a mother. Secondly, when I was getting married, I knew that something was missing. Though I hardly cry, I felt the pain deep in me. There are a lot of times I would cry in my closet though.</i></p><p><strong>What are the disadvantages of being a star?</strong></p><p><i>The negative side of it is that we spend a lot of money on touts. They don’t want to know whether you have money or not. Sometimes, you might go out without much in your pocket, but they will collect money from you at every junction; that we cannot help. It is the kind of society we have. I have been to Europe a number of times. There, they don’t ask you for money; instead they give you gifts. Someone gave me a phone; he just removed his SIM card, and handled over the phone to me. But in our society, it is the other way round.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>8 veteran actors ageing with grace</p><p><strong>If you were not an actress, what would you have been?</strong></p><p><i>I had wanted to be a broadcaster.

Though I was going through a certificate course, it was not like the real university thing. Then I was being distracted by movies jobs. Sometimes, procrastination in terms of obtaining forms made me miss so many opportunities. Before my four year degree programme I did a two year diploma course. That experience hurt me.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Jide Kosoko Is 62 Today</p><p><strong>Tell me in confidence, before you finally got married, how many men did you date?</strong></p><p><i>I dated like hundred (laugh). Really, I didn’t have that experience. The man that is my husband has always been with me since I was in secondary school. &nbsp;I remember the first JAMB I wrote, we did the ‘runs’ together. At that time, he was already a graduate.</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHN9lmtvZpuVobKjvsitsGabn6jBbr%2FOpZhmo5%2BovKy7jaGrpqQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-being-a-celebrity-has-cost-me-sola-kosoko.html&text=What%20being%20a%20celebrity%20has%20cost%20me%20%20Sola%20Kosoko&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-being-a-celebrity-has-cost-me-sola-kosoko.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-being-a-celebrity-has-cost-me-sola-kosoko.html&title=What%20being%20a%20celebrity%20has%20cost%20me%20%20Sola%20Kosoko" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-being-a-celebrity-has-cost-me-sola-kosoko.html&title=What%20being%20a%20celebrity%20has%20cost%20me%20%20Sola%20Kosoko" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-being-a-celebrity-has-cost-me-sola-kosoko.html&title=What%20being%20a%20celebrity%20has%20cost%20me%20%20Sola%20Kosoko" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-being-a-celebrity-has-cost-me-sola-kosoko.html&description=What%20being%20a%20celebrity%20has%20cost%20me%20%20Sola%20Kosoko" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./32-perfect-auburn-hairstyles-on-celebrities.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="32 Perfect Auburn Hairstyles on Celebrities">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./stream-popcaan-s-sophomore-album-forever.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stream Popcaan's Sophomore Album &amp;quot;Forever&amp;quot;">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
