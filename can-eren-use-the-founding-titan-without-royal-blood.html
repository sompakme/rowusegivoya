This is demonstrated when Eren Yeager temporarily used the Founder's power after striking the hand of Dina Fritz's Pure Titan.</span></span><h2>How did Eren get the founding Titan power without royal blood?</h2>In consuming his father, Eren took the abilities Grisha had gained from eating the queen, thus becoming the Founding Titan, able to control all Titans with his scream.<h2>Does Eren have access to the founding Titan?</h2>Eren has secretly been the holder of the Founding Titan ever since his father injected him with Titan serum, which happened before Attack on Titan even started. But he is unable to access its true powers. The Founding Titan was the first of the Nine Shifter Titans, first held by Ymir Fritz thousands of years ago.<h2>What if Eren had royal blood?</h2>Back to human form, he wouldn't have any contact with royal blood anymore, so he might not have the full Founding Titan's power. And, as specified in the manga and the anime, Eren was able to use the power of the Founding when he touched a TITAN of Royal Blood (Dinah Fritz).<h2>Does Eren posses have royal blood?</h2>Eren doesn't have a royal blood.<h2>DOES EREN Jaeger Have ROYAL BLOOD? Attack on Titan Anime Theory</h2><p></p><h2>Is Zeke a royal blood?</h2>Zeke does have royal blood, as his mother was Dina Fritz. However, as he's not seen as a direct descendant, his powers are limited. He can turn people into titans but only if they had some of his spinal fluid first. Also, his control over titans isn't absolute like Ymir's.<h2>What happens if Eren eats Zeke?</h2>If Eren ate Historia, nothing would happen, except that Historia would be dead and the Walls would need another Royal Blooded person to rule. If he ate Zeke, he would acquire the powers of the Beast Titan.<h2>What if Eren ate all the Titans?</h2>it's likely there exists a way for Eren to break the 13-year rule at the expense of obtaining, through the process of consumption, all nine titan powers. Show activity on this post. As all the titans were originally a single being, so eating all the titans should give Eren the power of the complete titan.<h2>Why can't Eren talk in Titan form?</h2>In the most recent chapter Eren said [wrote] that he couldn't talk in Titan form because of the shape of his mouth.<h2>What is Eren's new form called?</h2>Eren's New Attack Titan Form<p>Eren is set to kill everyone outside Paradis Island, considering them his enemies. Behind the multitude of Titans walking to destroy the land outside Paradis, Eren is controlling those Titans. In his new form, Eren's Titan looks scarier than ever before.</p><h2>How many Titans is Eren controlling?</h2>In Attack on Titan, Eren manages to acquire the power of three different Titans: the Attack Titan, the Warhammer Titan, and the Founding Titan.<h2>Who has royal blood in AOT?</h2>The Fritz family came to power as the royal bloodline of Eldia. Over these next two millennia, their lineage would be destined to remain unbroken. At some point during their rule, the Ackerman clan became the guarding force of their monarchy, serving as the protectors of the monarchs.<h2>Why is Eren's Titan so big?</h2>The defining feature of Eren's Founding Titan is a huge, snaking spine. This look is because Eren was decapitated by Gabi when he transformed, which caused the spine to grow abnormally so it could reconnect his body.<h2>What is the strongest Titan?</h2>1) Founding Titan<p>This Titan was used by Karl Fritz, Ymir Fritz, Frieda Reiss, Uri Reiss, Grisha Yeager, and Eren Jaeger. This is the most powerful Titan of the lot.</p><h2>Why does Eren's founding Titan look so weird?</h2>Eren has the same bony structure, but because his head was severed at the neck, his freaky Titan spine grows uncontrollably before connecting his torso and noggin, coming to form almost Eren's entire Founding Titan.<h2>What happens if Eren and Zeke touch?</h2>If Eren, who holds the Founding Titan, and Zeke, who possesses the royal blood necessary to use it, manage to come into contact, they will gain omnipotent control over all Titans and Subjects of Ymir, aka the Eldian people.<h2>How many Titans can Eren turn into?</h2>Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titans. After eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.<h2>Is the Cart Titan good?</h2>Speed. The Cart Titan also possesses great speed, similar to the Jaw Titan, which was exercised during the Battle of Shiganshina to retrieve a defeated Zeke Jaeger and Reiner Braun while also catching Levi and Hange, two of the Scout Regiment's most talented soldiers off guard.<h2>Does the Beast Titan have royal blood?</h2>Zeke Yeager's Beast Titan had several unique abilities that no other known Beast Titan had, thanks to his royal blood and throwing experience. The nature of its power was similar to that of the Founding Titan.<h2>What Titan can control Titans?</h2>Eren has the Coordinate ability, which allows him to control Titans. It is possible for a Titan to regain their mind and human form, as evidenced by Ymir regaining human form after 60 years.<h2>Why Zeke can make Titans?</h2>The soldiers releases a gas laced with Zeke's spinal fluid into the air, which is blown into the village and inhaled by the villagers. Zeke then lets out a scream, triggering all the affected Eldians to begin transforming into Titans.<h2>Is every Eldian of royal blood?</h2>All Subjects of Ymir are Eldians, but not all Eldians are Subjects of Ymir or Royal. Technically, every subject of Ymir has Royal blood, but it is not enough to make an impact.<h2>Is Zeke a Marley or Eldian?</h2>As you can see, Zeke is far from Marley's side, but he is not a supporter of his own people either. The Eldian race was enslaved by the Marley people after the Titans wreaked havoc on the world, and Zeke cannot reconcile himself to either the side.<h2>Does Wren have royal blood?</h2>The Founding Titan was meant to be passed down through the Reiss family's royal bloodline. Because Eren lacks royal blood, under normal circumstances he cannot access the Founding Titan's incredible abilities -- namely memory manipulation and command over hordes of pure Titans.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWadopq7bsHSnmStoJVis7DBzZ2gp59dqba1rc1mrqKsmKTCtXnRqLCapF2XubC7ww%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcan-eren-use-the-founding-titan-without-royal-blood.html&text=Can%20Eren%20use%20the%20founding%20Titan%20without%20royal%20blood%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcan-eren-use-the-founding-titan-without-royal-blood.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcan-eren-use-the-founding-titan-without-royal-blood.html&title=Can%20Eren%20use%20the%20founding%20Titan%20without%20royal%20blood%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcan-eren-use-the-founding-titan-without-royal-blood.html&title=Can%20Eren%20use%20the%20founding%20Titan%20without%20royal%20blood%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcan-eren-use-the-founding-titan-without-royal-blood.html&title=Can%20Eren%20use%20the%20founding%20Titan%20without%20royal%20blood%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcan-eren-use-the-founding-titan-without-royal-blood.html&description=Can%20Eren%20use%20the%20founding%20Titan%20without%20royal%20blood%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./celebrities-who-ve-received-duis-or-dwis.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebrities Whove Received DUIs or DWIs">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./anuhea-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anuhea Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
