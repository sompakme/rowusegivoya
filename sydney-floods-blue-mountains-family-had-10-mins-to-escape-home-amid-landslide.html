I’m hoping we can get back to what it was.”</p><p>Authorities have estimated that the damage from the floods spanning across both Queensland and NSW will cost as much as $2.5 billion when it is all added up.</p><p>Private insurance claims for ruined property such as houses and cars have already reached $936 million.<br></p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Sydney data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Sydney</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyzscClZJ6rpJbBpnvSspunnaliu7TDjqywnaaVrnqnuM6om6xlkqHCpnnMqKynrJGeu7R5xZqkoqSpYrSqwsSnZGpoXaK2r8HTnqpmrJ9isrSvwKmcZqCforJurcyim2akkaOxtLjInZxoppWswG6%2F06ipsmdpZ4NyhJZyZ55tYGyBpK2Tm5trm5aWhHl%2Bj2lqcG1paw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsydney-floods-blue-mountains-family-had-10-mins-to-escape-home-amid-landslide.html&text=Sydney%20floods%3a%20Blue%20Mountains%20family%20had%2010%20mins%20to%20escape%20home%20amid%20landslide&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsydney-floods-blue-mountains-family-had-10-mins-to-escape-home-amid-landslide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsydney-floods-blue-mountains-family-had-10-mins-to-escape-home-amid-landslide.html&title=Sydney%20floods%3a%20Blue%20Mountains%20family%20had%2010%20mins%20to%20escape%20home%20amid%20landslide" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsydney-floods-blue-mountains-family-had-10-mins-to-escape-home-amid-landslide.html&title=Sydney%20floods%3a%20Blue%20Mountains%20family%20had%2010%20mins%20to%20escape%20home%20amid%20landslide" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsydney-floods-blue-mountains-family-had-10-mins-to-escape-home-amid-landslide.html&title=Sydney%20floods%3a%20Blue%20Mountains%20family%20had%2010%20mins%20to%20escape%20home%20amid%20landslide" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsydney-floods-blue-mountains-family-had-10-mins-to-escape-home-amid-landslide.html&description=Sydney%20floods%3a%20Blue%20Mountains%20family%20had%2010%20mins%20to%20escape%20home%20amid%20landslide" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-white-pastel-base-paint.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is white pastel base paint?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sophia-yan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sophia Yan">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
