In fact, by the time the relationship implodes, you’re pretty sure they didn’t even like you – whereas you were mad about them, so there must be something wrong, deep down, with you, right?</p><p>Covering up their cheating by gaslighting you into thinking you’re crazy and imagining things. Criticising you for things you didn’t even know you did, painting a picture of you that you don’t recognise. Shouting at you then meting out “the silent treatment”.</p><p>Insulting those you love – behind their back – having spent the entire evening smiling to their faces. Discarding you for no reason, only to hoover you up the second you’re getting over them and enticing you back into the tumult of love. Of course the moment they’ve got you back, they start going off you again…</p><p>If this sounds like the sort of relationship pattern you’ve been caught up in, chances are you’ve been dating a narcissist. Welcome to the wonderland of Emily Hill, spinster and lunatic – always meeting Daniel Cleaver and never once hearing an “I like you, just the way you are” from Darcy.</p><p>The last break-up left her so disassociated she wants to insist this piece isn’t about her at all and write about herself in the third person, while admitting to being on the verge of doing something so destructive the universe intervened, and she found she was listening – helpless – to the words of a sinister-voiced man on YouTube, who provoked a revelation that she hopes might help you, if you’re starting to suspect you might be like her...</p><p>HG Tudor has devoted an entire channel to picking apart pretty much everything Meghan Markle has ever done, and alleging that every single act that made zero sense to us is evidence of unconscious narcissism. Like the old Roberta Flack song, suddenly someone was “singing my life with his words…”.</p><span></span><p>Down the YouTube rabbit hole I fell, and met <a href=#>Dr Ramani Durvasula</a>, professor of psychology at California State University, Los Angeles, whose channel explains what narcissism is and will take you on a tour of everyone you’ve ever met who’s screamed “off with her head” for no discernible reason, and every ex-lover who’s disappeared into thin air leaving only a Cheshire cat grin.</p><p>“Curiouser and curiouser,” you may mutter, before concluding, “My God, there is something wrong with me – I’m addicted to narcissists!” Dr Ramani’s advice is to accept it, go cold turkey for a year, and kick the habit.</p><p>There’s no high on earth like a narcissist’s romancing. There he is, the prince you were promised. An actual frog – in some cases – the fairy-tale came true, all you had to do was give into his insistent demands you kiss him, and poof! Reversing sexes (narcissists come in all guises), you thought you were rescuing Cinderella and ended up with her wicked stepmother.</p><p>The narcissistic personality exists on a spectrum that ranges from benign to malignant, grandiose to covert, so if he or she’s a looker, s/he’ll be charming, charismatic and confident, and if not, quiet, brooding and persistent. Pay attention to the eyebrows. Everyone has them – but a narcissist’s are likely to be exceptionally well-groomed.</p><p>To cut a not very long story short, you do not live happily ever after. As soon as s/he’s overwhelmed your worries about how overwhelming s/he is (and you’ve thanked your lucky stars because s/he walks on water) you’ll soon realise s/he tempted you into a fool’s paradise, and you’re sleeping with the devil who roasts you with criticism, tortures you with invalidation, and gaslights you without remorse. Soon enough, you won’t recognise yourself. And nor will s/he. So s/he’ll discard you and replace you with someone who looks just like you did – before you met them.</p><p>Depending on how much you’re willing to put up with, your relationship can end on the second drink because s/he’s been rude to the staff (pay attention to how s/he treats the waiter) or until death do you part, after which you enjoy an inexplicably happy widowhood.</p><p>Divorcing a narcissist – or having to parent through shared custody – is often an agony those outside the marriage struggle to understand. Your life may look perfect – beautiful children, always enjoying the best of everything, a spouse who’s “such a good provider”! And yet, the truth is…</p><p>“Narcissism and healthy love really don’t fit well together,” says Dr Ramani, when I speak to her at her practice in LA. “The qualities of narcissism – lack of empathy, entitlement, superficiality, arrogance, rage, incapacity for deep and connected intimacy since they view relationships largely through a lens of personal gain – really aren’t a good set-up for a long-term, consistent and loving relationship.’”</p><p>When you fall in love with a narcissist, she explains, “there is a period called ‘love bombing’, characterised by idealisation and seduction and people can be rather blinded by this phase… So the simple answer is that narcissism complicates the pursuit of love – it can be quite seductive at the beginning and then end up being painful and destructive because in short order ‘love bombing’ shifts to ‘devaluation’ and ‘discarding’.”</p><p>How long the love-bombing lasts depends on how long the narcissist needs to keep it up until s/he’s got you, and since I have what would once have been termed “daddy issues” (and which, post-Ramani, I translate to “my father – God bless him – is a narcissist and can no more help this than if he’d had been involved in a childhood accident, had no legs and couldn’t walk…”) they have me in a trice.</p><p>Dating a narcissist is like dealing with a toddler: they want it all, they want it now, and if you can’t give it to them (quite often because you can’t read their mind, so have no idea what it is they want), they’ll throw an epic tantrum, or sulk – for days, weeks, sometimes years.</p><p>Every woman wants to marry a man like her father but, alas, I’m not my mother – the patron saint of dealing with him – so I’ve never met a version of him who proposed.</p><span></span><p>We all have narcissistic traits and engage in narcissistic behaviours so if you’re reading this, biting your lip nervously, thinking: “Sometimes I act out in relationships. Maybe I’m a narcissist…?” Congratulations! You’re not a narcissist. You’re capable of self-reflection, regret over past bad behaviour, and its impact on other people.</p><p>Narcissists run from their own shame, so they’ll have skipped straight to the comments section on purpose to tell all the narcissists who aren’t going to bother reading this at all because they didn’t like the headline that the sad little woman who wrote it should take a good look in the mirror and stop blaming all her problems on&nbsp;them.</p><p>So how do you spot a narcissist when dating? “Listen for the throwaway hurtful and contemptuous comments,” says Dr Ramani. “Such as comparing you to former partners or other people. (‘Why don’t you wear your hair more like that? Why don’t you dress like her? This woman in my office is able to manage so much...’) Portraying themselves as a victim, that sort of sullen, resentful entitled victimisation (‘That guy is a loser; the only reason he got ahead is daddy gave him a trust fund. Life isn’t fair; I had to earn everything myself.’) Being odd about money – either really controlling with it, or you feel they are keeping a spreadsheet on dating costs. Being really ungenerous about their space (‘I like things the way I like them’) leaving you eggshell-walking in their space...”</p><p>Pay particular attention to how they treat the people who “don’t matter”. They’ll be trying to win you over but they don’t need to win over that waiter… They also have a tendency – says Dr Ramani – “to drive in a dangerous or aggressive manner”.</p><p>My habitual advice – since I was first asked to write a dating column for work (at a time when I was brokenhearted over a man who – yes! – was a narcissist) is that dating apps are machines devised by Silicon Valley to annihilate human love (because you won’t need their apps for that) and replace it with sex.</p><p>“Not everyone on dating apps is narcissistic,” says Dr Ramani. “But you may fall into the abyss of these relationships, because in quicksilver spaces like dating apps narcissists are better at the superficial presentation and the witty repartee that often characterises the early text messaging.”</p><p>On her YouTube channel, Dr Ramani often uses the wisdom of proverbs and famous quotes. She’s not yet explored “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”, but when I look back at my life that’s what I see. The cognitive dissonance I developed in childhood (“Daddy doesn’t love me – I must be unlovable”) acting out in adult life. If you relate to this at all, it may be time to kiss goodbye to narcissists, and conclude: “It’s not me – it’s them.”</p><h3>The two types of narcissist&nbsp;</h3><h4>Grandiose</h4><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Ever charming, charismatic, cocky, the grandiose narcissist gains power in pleasure and profit&nbsp;</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Alex Mellon</span></figure><p>“This is the classical, textbook narcissist. Charming, charismatic, cocky, arrogant, confident, often on top of the world, attractive, well put together, articulate... The ones we associate with glamour, success and celebrity. They love power, pleasure and profit.”</p><p>This describes the man I&nbsp;now call “Mr Maldives” since that’s&nbsp;where he whisked me within a&nbsp;fortnight. I thought it was love at first&nbsp;sight for us both – and felt so stupid when he couldn’t even reply to&nbsp;my text messages six weeks later.</p><p>It also defines almost every man I have been on a date with on every single dating app – Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, you name it, they’re on it.</p><h4>Covert</h4><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Covert narcissists present as victimised or even needy, but you'll soon find yourself drained if trying to fix their issues&nbsp;</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Alex Mellon</span></figure><p>“Vulnerable, anxious, socially less skilled... Covert narcissists often present as victimised or even needy.” If&nbsp;you’re empathetic, you’ll be so caught up trying to fix their problems for them, you won’t notice that they were arrogant, entitled, sullen and irritable and never appreciated any of&nbsp;your efforts.</p><p>You feel constantly exhausted and more like their parent than their partner. This describes the man who cried the first time I kissed him because he was so lonely and the&nbsp;great love of my 20s, whose sulks&nbsp;seemed so inexplicable up to&nbsp;this&nbsp;point. Never, ever start sleeping&nbsp;with anyone because you&nbsp;feel&nbsp;sorry for them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJ6RoratxY6rnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqesZ6Saua15z5qpraaVp3qvrdGcoKyrmajBcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-to-tell-if-your-partner-is-a-narcissist.html&text=How%20to%20tell%20if%20your%20partner%20is%20a%20narcissist&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-to-tell-if-your-partner-is-a-narcissist.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-tell-if-your-partner-is-a-narcissist.html&title=How%20to%20tell%20if%20your%20partner%20is%20a%20narcissist" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-to-tell-if-your-partner-is-a-narcissist.html&title=How%20to%20tell%20if%20your%20partner%20is%20a%20narcissist" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-tell-if-your-partner-is-a-narcissist.html&title=How%20to%20tell%20if%20your%20partner%20is%20a%20narcissist" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-to-tell-if-your-partner-is-a-narcissist.html&description=How%20to%20tell%20if%20your%20partner%20is%20a%20narcissist" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kerry-shook-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kerry Shook  Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-do-you-set-the-cruise-control-on-a-2016-chevy-cruze.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How do you set the cruise control on a 2016 Chevy Cruze?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
