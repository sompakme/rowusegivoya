Video blogger Gabbi Hanna recently posted a video claiming he physically assaulted her and destroyed her cellphone.&nbsp;She later posted a video of the injuries she inflicted on RiceGum on Snapchat.&nbsp;Strangely, this tiff led to an increase in its subscribers and a decrease in its subscribers.</span></p><p><span>He agreed to throw away the cellphone but added that the injuries were actually stretch marks.&nbsp;Viewers, however, felt that he could have handled the matter more politely and that he was too caustic.&nbsp;Although Gabbi Hanna did not take legal action, she requested compensation for her mobile phone.&nbsp;Additionally, Ricegum was banned from Twitch for showing off a BB gun in one of his videos.&nbsp;We can say that it is a major pole of attraction.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Gay Vibes and&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Body Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Reports say he’s straight.&nbsp;Ricegum once said on one of his shows that he was single and didn’t have a girlfriend because he was ugly as f**k.</span></p><p><span>The rice gum measures approximately 1.99m.&nbsp;Although his photo clearly shows that he is thin, no exact figure is given for his weight.&nbsp;He also has brown eyes and black hair.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Rice Gum Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>From all the controversies and many leads he has encountered, it is currently estimated that Ricegum has a net worth of over $1 million.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiqmZiyqMHMZqqiq6Sav26zyKujn6qZmrulec2eq2avn6fBqXnHnqCgoKRitbDB0p5ksKGbnnqlrdSgn62domK0osWO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fricegum-sister-girlfriend-net-worth-height-house-daughter-gay.html&text=Ricegum%20Sister%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20House%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Gay&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fricegum-sister-girlfriend-net-worth-height-house-daughter-gay.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fricegum-sister-girlfriend-net-worth-height-house-daughter-gay.html&title=Ricegum%20Sister%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20House%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Gay" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fricegum-sister-girlfriend-net-worth-height-house-daughter-gay.html&title=Ricegum%20Sister%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20House%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Gay" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fricegum-sister-girlfriend-net-worth-height-house-daughter-gay.html&title=Ricegum%20Sister%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20House%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Gay" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fricegum-sister-girlfriend-net-worth-height-house-daughter-gay.html&description=Ricegum%20Sister%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20House%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Gay" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rob-base-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rob Base Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lil-durk-argues-he-has-more-than-listed-3-million-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lil Durk Argues He Has More Than Listed $3 Million Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
