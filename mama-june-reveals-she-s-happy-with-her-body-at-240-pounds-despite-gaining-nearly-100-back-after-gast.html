If I don't and I don't go any higher than where I am, I'm pretty cool with where I'm at right now," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>While the mother-of-four revealed she is happy with her weight at the moment, she hasn't totally sworn off the idea of going back <a href=#>under the knife</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've thought about <a href=#>doing the gastric sleeve again, like&nbsp;the revision</a> surgery, but who knows, I would have to take care of some other issues first before I can be able to do that," June, 42, added.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>June</a>, who starred in Mama June: From Not to Hot, underwent gastric sleeve surgery in 2016, which was followed by a tummy tuck.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in January, The Sun had exclusively revealed the grandmother-of-four had taken a visit to a weight-loss surgeon's office. &nbsp;</p><h2>THE DOCTOR WILL SEE YOU NOW&nbsp;</h2><p>Earlier this year June and <a href=#>her boyfriend&nbsp;Justin Stroud</a>, 34, were spotted making their way into the offices of Dr. Michael Feiz who did her gastric sleeve surgery back in 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>The Mama June: From Not to Hot&nbsp;star, said during a <a href=#>live stream</a>&nbsp;with fans that she gained 100-pounds since getting sober two years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>June candidly opened up as&nbsp;<a href=#>she celebrated two years of sobriety</a>&nbsp;from drugs and alcohol that she was struggling with her food addiction, which had resulted in the weight gain. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It's unclear the exact nature of her visit to Dr. Feiz’s office on Friday, but she was in and out within an hour.&nbsp;</p><p>Her trip to the doctor's office was part of a larger getaway to sunny southern California, where June and her love took in a fair,&nbsp;<a href=#>canoodled on a carousel</a>, and went for a hike- all while he had an outstanding warrant for his arrest back in Alabama.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;TV star has been dating the auto-mechanic, who once&nbsp;<a href=#>posed in front of a Confederate Flag for a photo</a>&nbsp;in a now-deleted Facebook profile, since last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>June first mentioned that she had a new "boo" without revealing his identity when she showed off a tattoo he had done on her Instagram stories in her home state of Georgia on October 13th.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>WHIRLWIND ROMANCE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>The mother of four broke up with her longtime boyfriend Geno Doak in early 2021 and was&nbsp;<a href=#>briefly linked to&nbsp;TikToker&nbsp;Jordan McCollum</a>&nbsp;before she shared Justin's new tattoo in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The money-rose tattoo sits above an older piece Justin had done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In her October IG story clip, June&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;give any clues as to who her new love interest was, and only tagged the tattoo artist who did the piece for Justin.&nbsp;</p><p>On October 18th, Justin showed off the new ink in a bathroom selfie on his Instagram page, tagging his location in Atlanta, Georgia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>MAMA'S LAST LOVE AFFAIR WAS ROCKY&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>June had a&nbsp;<a href=#>tumultuous relationship</a>&nbsp;with her&nbsp;ex Geno&nbsp;as the couple struggled with&nbsp;<a href=#>substance abuse and both got arrested</a>&nbsp;during their three-year-romance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Sun exclusively revealed that&nbsp;<a href=#>Geno had been sentenced to 16 months in prison</a>&nbsp;on drug charges after his ex&nbsp;<a href=#>narrowly avoided any jail</a>&nbsp;time related to the same 2019 incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>According to court records, Geno was admitted into the Alabama prison system on July 29th,&nbsp;and was given a release date of&nbsp;November&nbsp;28, 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Geno's sentence will be served through the Community Corrections Program based out of&nbsp;Macon county.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title

2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Geno was also hit with a third-degree domestic violence charge, as well as a charge of possession of drug
