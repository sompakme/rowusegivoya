First up, what actually is it? "LED stands for Light Emitting Diode," she said. "The benefits are all a result of the light, which emits therapeutic wavelengths of light energy to energise the cell, stimulating the production of everything from elastin to collagen. It’s not just for your face either! If you have acne on your chest or back, or if you want to do away with sun damage or crepiness, you can have a session to target those larger areas."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/afeb24e37140-debra-messing-led-light-mask.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Do LED face masks help with stress and anxiety?</h2><p id=eQ-8FrktEjo data-wc=115>Laura said: "An LED face mask can help combat stress and anxiety. Near-Infrared has a balancing effect on cortisol, which is commonly referred to as the stress hormone, while ‘happy’ hormones like serotonin and dopamine are triggered by the lights. Added to that is the sensation of the warm lights cocooning you as you kick back for fifteen minutes (or less), so you can absolutely expect to feel zen. It’ll bolster your immune system and improve the quality of your sleep. You can thank upped antioxidants plus increased blood flow for the immune system bit, and more melatonin and serotonin - aka the hormones that send you into a blissful sleep - for the sleep."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3290c5145406-trinny-woodall-face-mask.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>What kind of prep do I need to do to use an LED mask?</h2><p id=ef-Um8COyOA data-wc=76>"There’s no prep required. You don’t need to do anything special pre or post LED light therapy. This makes slotting it into your day easy as can be - it doesn’t matter what condition your skin is in, or what you’re doing directly after your treatment. Also, your skin won’t be more sensitised to the sun as it can be after some facials, so you don’t need to worry if you’re about to go on holiday."</p><h2 dir=ltr>What do the different light colours mean on a LED face mask?</h2><p id=edNW2lYTLb_ data-wc=67><strong>Blue light:&nbsp;</strong>"Targets and destroys acne bacteria found in the sebaceous glands, which reduces bacteria and the forming of blemishes or pustules. It also regulates oil production, balancing an oily skin or t-zone and increases blood circulation, which helps to eliminate toxins and provide nutrients to the skin. Blue light has an anti-inflammatory effect on the skin, which reduces healing time and also prevents post inflammatory scarring."</p><p id=evyw7Gk7NRF data-wc=46><strong>Red light:&nbsp;</strong>"Stimulates collagen and elastin within the dermis, increases blood flow and oxygenation to the skin, all while delivering nutrients and antioxidants to repair. Increases regeneration so that skin looks and feels plumper, brighter, with improved density in the dermis to support the ageing process."</p><p id=et3KZWnCfLC data-wc=162><strong>Near-Infrared:&nbsp;</strong>"Penetrates deep into the skin and can reach the bone, increasing cellular activity so that our cells behave in a more responsive manner. Increases the production collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid to maintain the skin’s structure for a more youthful appearance. Near-Infrared also reduces inflammation and pain by increasing blood flow and tissue oxygenation, supports cellular health and repairs damage. In terms of skin tone, it regulates the production of melanin and increases antioxidants and nutrients within the skin. It also balances hormones such as cortisol (the stress hormone), serotonin (the feel-good hormone) and melatonin (our sleep hormone).Our award-winning devices for the face and body have gained a cult-like status and are a constant fixture in the beauty press. They deliver the most clinically proven wavelengths to regenerate the skin at a cellular level, resulting in a healthy, glowing complexion and a reduction in the appearance of wrinkles.

Some claim to have seen a difference from the masks in just one use.</p><h2 data-gid=eEXEKd2HADb>When to use LED face mask in routine</h2><p id=eQ_eKD0ps28 data-wc=34>It's fairly easy. LED light therapy should be undertaken when the skin is clean - after removing makeup and thoroughly cleansing the skin, and before you apply any other face serums, moisturisers or treatments.</p><h2 data-gid=eEXEKd2HADb>Can you use LED face mask every day?&nbsp;</h2><p id=elJlam9hhaJ data-wc=108>Laura said: "For best results, treat skin for a minimum of 3 to 5 days a week for 10 minutes. We recommend also doing a sensitisation patch test prior to your first dose of light. Just place the BOOST LED Device over your inner arm and allow it to run for the full 10 minutes. If your skin feels hot or uncomfortable, stop using the device immediately. After the treatment, wait at least six hours. If the skin on your inner arm is red or itchy, the BOOST LED Device is unsuitable for you. If after six hours there is no reaction, use your LED mask as normal."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The best collagen supplements – what are the benefits & do they really work?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/36628308b7c9-best-collagen-supplements-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The best collagen supplements – what are the benefits & do they really work?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The best collagen supplements – what are the benefits & do they really work?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I'm 41 and I tried The Ordinary’s TikTok skincare hack - here's my honest opinion" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/66b6151e423a-ordinary-tried-and-tested.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I'm 41 and I tried The Ordinary’s TikTok skincare hack - here's my honest opinion" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I'm 41 and I tried The Ordinary’s TikTok skincare hack - here's my honest opinion</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="8 best skin barrier repair creams - plus, why you might need to apply one at this time of year" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/14938840d8e6-barrier-repair-cream-istock-1243082545.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="8 best skin barrier repair creams - plus, why you might need to apply one at this time of year" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>8 best skin barrier repair creams - plus, why you might need to apply one at this time of year</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
