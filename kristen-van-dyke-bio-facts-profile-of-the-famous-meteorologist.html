love with how scary and incredible the weather can be.&nbsp;She is an outdoor enthusiast and is currently Fox 13’s Lead Meteorologist in Utah.&nbsp;The talented meteorologist has predicted tornadoes, blizzards, flash floods, spring winds and wildfires.&nbsp;She’s also a self-described “weather geek.”&nbsp;Learn more about Kristen below.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Kristen Van Dyke – Biography & Profile</span></strong></h2><p><span>Kristen Van Dyke is her parents’ first child.&nbsp;She was born and raised in South Carolina with her two younger siblings (Katie and Scott).&nbsp;Kristen grew up fascinated by the weather.&nbsp;She witnessed Hurricane Hugo sweep through her hometown and was in awe.&nbsp;She recounts how devastating the experience was when much of the area was badly affected.&nbsp;Because of this horrific experience, she decided to learn the science behind it.</span></p><p><span>With her love and appreciation for the outdoors at her side, Kristen attended college in Charleston, South Carolina in 2000.&nbsp;An old but very respected school that did its coveted bachelor’s degree in Communication and Media Studies in 2005.</span></p><p><span>Kristen Van Dyke never lost sight of her initial goal, which was to learn the science behind weather.&nbsp;She earned a certificate in meteorology from Mississippi State University, graduating in 2009.&nbsp;It is also a member of the American Meteorological Society and was awarded the Seal of Approval in 2008.</span></p><p><span>Kristen from a tender age knew what she wanted from life and would do anything to get it.&nbsp;She knew that being a meteorologist would not be enough if she did not have the skills to present her findings professionally.&nbsp;Therefore, she studied communications before completing her studies in geosciences.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Facts about the famous meteorologist</span></strong></h2><h3><strong><span>Kristen Van Dyke’s&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>job profile</span></strong></h3><p><span>Kristen Van Dyke started at WPDE, a local news station in her home state of South Carolina.&nbsp;At the time, she was covering and reporting on numerous tropical storms and even Hurricane Ernesto in South Carolina and Florida.</span></p><p><span>The brilliant meteorologist was also one of the people who predicted the deadly tornado outbreak that struck the South in March 2008.&nbsp;She worked at this station as a weekend meteorologist until September 2010, about a year after graduating from Mississippi.</span></p><p><span>After a fruitful career in her home state, Kristen saw the need to venture out of her comfort zone.&nbsp;She got an opportunity and soon moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico.&nbsp;Not the type to be discouraged by a challenge, she wanted to explore a different aspect of her career.&nbsp;She was the host of the New Mexico Style program, which featured various local specialties and interesting lifestyle news, which she presented for KASA Fox 2 and KRQE News 13.</span></p><p><span>The program was both a starting point and a stepping stone for her when Kristen was later promoted to morning and noon weather forecaster for the two stations.&nbsp;Kristen retained this position for three years until April 2014.&nbsp;Shortly after leaving the station, Kristen Van Dyke made another move after receiving an offer to become chief meteorologist at KOIN 6, a Portland-based CBS affiliate.&nbsp;She worked in this capacity for three years before leaving the network in May 2017.&nbsp;Kristen cited family and personal reasons as the reason for her departure.</span></p><p><span>In 2017, Kristen joined the Fox 13 KSTU team as Chief Meteorologist.&nbsp;A position she maintains to this day.&nbsp;She tells of moving to Utah that she has been enchanted by the landscape and mountains since she was young.&nbsp;Kristen learned to snowboard and ski in Utah and has taken many vacations there.&nbsp;She is happy to call Utah her home.</span></p><h3><strong><span>Her husband and family</span></strong></h3><p><span>Kristen Van Dyke creates a clear distinction between her personal and professional life.&nbsp;While much is known and seen about her professional life, she keeps her personal life out of the media.&nbsp;Although it is known that Kristen married her longtime boyfriend Tom Nelson in December 2018;&nbsp;Not much is known about their relationship.&nbsp;They currently live in Salt Lake City with their two dogs (Ranger and Harper).</span></p><h3><strong><span>Size: how tall is she?</span></strong></h3><p><span>Kristen Van Dyke is 5 feet 3 inches tall.&nbsp;Despite not being very tall, she’s managed to complete some pretty tall challenges.&nbsp;The meteorologist extraordinaire was previously diagnosed with melanoma (a highly malignant skin tumor).&nbsp;She was able to treat and overcome it because of the early diagnosis.</span></p><p><span>When she’s not predicting the weather, she spends her time biking, hiking, snowboarding, and camping in the mountains with her dogs.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
