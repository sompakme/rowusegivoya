Rayon does shrink, which is one of the reasons why it is increasingly being combined with other textiles. While spandex is not renowned for shrinking, when it is combined with other textiles that do shrink (cotton, linen, rayon, tencel), there is the possibility of shrinkage. It is advised that rayon be dry cleaned only when used alone.
A similar question is whether rayon spandex blends can be machine washed.</description></item><item><title>www.nysc.org.ng | NYSC portal login and registration</title><link>/www-nysc-org-ng-nysc-portal-login-and-registration.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/www-nysc-org-ng-nysc-portal-login-and-registration.html</guid><description>Are you looking for a way to access the NYSC portal?

We investigate the law in North Carolina to see whether or not it is indeed prohibited to drive without shoes. It is not unlawful to drive without shoes in the United States.
