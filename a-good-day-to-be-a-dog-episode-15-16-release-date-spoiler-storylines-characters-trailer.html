In the previous episodes, we saw that Han Hae-na and Jin Seo-won confessed their feelings for each other and shared a passionate kiss. However, this triggered the curse and Han Hae-na turned into a dog. Jin Seo-won, who was terrified of dogs, ran away from her, leaving her heartbroken.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lee Bo-gyeom, who had a crush on Han Hae-na, found out about her secret and decided to help her. He took her to his house and tried to comfort her. He also learned that the only way to break the curse was to kiss her again while she was a dog. He was willing to do that, but Han Hae-na refused, saying that she only loved Jin Seo-won.</p><p>On the other hand, Jin Seo-won realized that he had made a mistake and decided to face his fear of dogs. He went to Lee Bo-gyeom’s house and asked for Han Hae-na. Lee Bo-gyeom lied to him and said that she was not there. He then locked Han Hae-na in his room and attempted to kiss her. However, Han Hae-na bit him and escaped. She ran to Jin Seo-won and jumped into his arms. Jin Seo-won overcame his fear and hugged her. He then kissed her, breaking the curse and turning her back into a human.</p><p>The upcoming episodes will show the aftermath of this dramatic event. Will Han Hae-na and Jin Seo-won be able to stay together without any more obstacles? Will Lee Bo-gyeom accept his defeat and move on? Will the other characters find out about the curse and the truth? Will there be a happy ending for everyone?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Storylines-of-A-Good-Day-to-Be-a-Dog-Episode-15-16.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Storylines_and_Plot></span>Storylines and Plot<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The show has several storylines that are intertwined with the main plot. Here are some of the storylines that have been developed throughout the show:</p><ul><li>The love triangle between Han Hae-na, Jin Seo-won, and Lee Bo-gyeom. Lee Bo-gyeom is a history teacher who has a crush on Han Hae-na. He is kind, caring, and handsome, but he is also jealous and possessive. He tries to win Han Hae-na’s heart, but he is unaware of her curse and her feelings for Jin Seo-won. He also has a rivalry with Jin Seo-won, who is his childhood friend and his opposite in personality. Jin Seo-won is a math teacher who is cold, aloof, and arrogant, but he is also smart, handsome, and loyal. He falls in love with Han Hae-na, but he is afraid of dogs and does not know how to express his emotions. He also has a traumatic past that haunts him.</li><li>The friendship between Han Hae-na and Yoon Chae-ah. Yoon Chae-ah is an English teacher who is Han Hae-na’s best friend. She is cheerful, bubbly, and supportive, but she is also insecure and lonely. She has a crush on Choi Yul, a music teacher who is handsome, talented, and popular, but he is also arrogant, rude, and insensitive. He does not reciprocate her feelings and often ignores her. She tries to impress him, but she also gets hurt by him.</li><li>The romance between Han Yu-na and Song Woo-taek. Han Yu-na is Han Hae-na’s younger sister who is a college student. She is rebellious, spoiled, and immature, but she is also cute, lively, and honest. She has a crush on Song Woo-taek, a webtoon artist who is the older brother of Song Da-eun, Han Hae-na’s student. He is cool, handsome, and creative, but he is also shy, introverted, and awkward. He likes Han Yu-na, but he does not know how to approach her. He also has a secret that he does not want anyone to know.</li><li>The mystery behind the curse. The curse that affects Han Hae-na and her family has been passed down for generations. The origin of the curse is unknown, but it is said that it was caused by a witch who was betrayed by her lover. The curse makes the women in the family turn into a dog when they kiss someone, and the only way to break it is to kiss the same person again while they are a dog. The curse also has some side effects, such as making the women more attractive, more fertile, and more loyal. The curse also affects the men who kiss them, making them more protective, more possessive, and more obsessed.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Trailer-of-A-Good-Day-to-Be-a-Dog-Episode-15-16.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Trailer></span>Trailer <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The official trailer for A Good Day to Be a Dog was released on September 28, 2023, by MBC Drama.
